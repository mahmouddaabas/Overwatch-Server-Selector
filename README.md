# Overwatch-Server-Selector
Overwatch Server Selector adds a rule to the firewall that blocks game servers to allow the user to play in a specific region.
The rules will automatically be deleted and removed from the firewall when the application is closed.

Works for Overwatch 2.

Regions you can currently play in:

2. Middle East
